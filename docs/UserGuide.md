# MindMap User Guide

MindMap is a **desktop app that helps you manage your contacts efficiently, combining the speed of typing commands with the ease of a visual interface.**

It’s designed for professionals like psychologists who work with many contacts and prefer a fast, straightforward tool.

With MindMap, you can accomplish tasks quickly by typing simple commands, and you still get a clear, user-friendly screen to view and organize your contacts.

If you’re comfortable typing, MindMap can help you get contact management tasks done much faster than traditional apps that rely heavily on point-and-click with a mouse.

## Quick start

1. **Check Your Java Version**  
   Make sure Java **version 17** or above is installed on your computer. <br> <box type="info" seamless>Java is a software platform that lets you run certain types of applications, including `.jar` files. [Learn more about Java here](https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/whatis_java.xml). <br> To check your current Java version, [learn more here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html). <br>[Download Java here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) if needed. </box>


2. **Download MindMap**  
   Download the latest `.jar` file for MindMap from [this link](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/releases). <br> <box type="info" seamless> A `.jar` file is a single file that contains everything needed to run a program. Think of it like a zipped folder that, when opened, lets you start using the application right away. <br> <br> To run it, you just need Java installed on your computer. </box>


3. **Choose a Folder**  
   Copy the `.jar` file to a folder you’d like to use as the home for your MindMap contacts.


4. **Open a Terminal**
   <br> <box type="info" seamless> We’ll use the Terminal (or PowerShell on Windows) to enter a few simple commands to launch the MindMap app. </box>
    - **For Windows**:
        - Open the Start menu, type “Windows PowerShell”, and click on it to open.

    - **For Mac**:
        - Press `Command + Space` to open the search bar.
        - Type "Terminal" and select it from the results.

5. **Get the Folder Path**
    - For **Windows**: Hold `Shift` and `Right-click` the folder containing the `.jar` file and select **Copy as Path**.
    - For **Mac**: [Follow these steps](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://macpaw.com/how-to/copy-file-path-mac%23:~:text%3DControl%252Dclick%2520or%2520right%252Dclick%2520on%2520the%2520file%2520in%2520Finder,path%2520wherever%2520you%2520need%2520it.&ved=2ahUKEwiUn6S_jseJAxWVxzgGHTVQJQsQFnoECBQQAw&usg=AOvVaw22hRilijfEWC_nmiYfJzmQ) to copy the folder path.

6. **Navigate to the Folder in Terminal**  
   In the terminal, type the following line and press Enter:
   ```bash
   cd [paste the folder path from step 5 here]
   ```
   If successful, this command will take you into the folder where your .jar file is located.
   
7. **Start MindMap**  
   Now, type the following line in the terminal to launch the app:
   ```bash
   java -jar mindmap.jar
   ```
   This will open the MindMap app. You’re now ready to use it! If you see an error, double-check that Java is installed using **Step 1**.


8. **Get Started with the App**  
   In a few seconds, you'll see the MindMap interface open with some sample contacts to explore.
> **NOTE**: The app contains some sample data.<br>

   
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

9. **Try Out Some Commands**  
   Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/STATUS]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/LOW` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: Can the new **M** FIN series introduced in Singapore From 1 January 2022 onwards be used?<br>
**A**:Unfortunately, no. Our application only supports the format of the **F** and **G** FIN series, and for the **S** and **T** series for the NRIC. Also note that while most valid NRIC/FIN are able to be recognised by our application, some would inevitably fail as the Singapore Government does not disclose the true method to verify NRIC/FIN.

## Known Issues

1. **Application Opening Off-Screen on Single-Monitor Setup**  
   When using multiple screens, if the application is moved to a secondary screen and the setup later reverts to a single screen, the application may open off-screen.  
   > **Workaround**: Delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application, then restart the application.

2. **Help Window Remains Minimized**  
   If the Help Window is minimized and the `help` command is executed again (or the `Help` menu or `F1` keyboard shortcut is used), the existing Help Window will remain minimized without reopening or restoring. <br>
   > **Workaround**: Manually restore the Help Window from the minimized state.

3. **Unable to Navigate List Items with Tab Key**  
   When using the Tab key to navigate, individual items in lists (like the person list) cannot be accessed.  
   > **Workaround**: Currently, there is no workaround for this.
